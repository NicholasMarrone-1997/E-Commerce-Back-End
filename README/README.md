# Unit 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description 

The purpose of the E-Commerce Back End assigment was to build a back end for an e-commerce site by modifiying starter code. We had to update the database models, execute association methods on the sequelize models, fill out the API Routes, Seed the Database, and get the data in Postman.

## User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment 
variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
